                notes:
                  - The boss will move to the center and spawn orbs in a variety
                    of patterns.
                  - These orbs will trigger column AoE's from their location,
                    covering the arena in criss-cross patterns.
                  - Safe zones will be targeted by Thumbscrew, so be careful.

                  - While the orbs from Brazen Bull trigger their column AoEs,
                    the boss will face the safe zone and divebomb to the edge of
                    the arena.
                  - This part of the attack is telegraphed with a distinct blue
                    column.

              - AoE (Cone)
            notes:

                necessary.
        notes:
          - There are a lot of AoEs going on in this fight - pay attention to
            patterns to learn the safe spots.
  - name: Tesleen, the Forgiven
    phases:
      - notes:
          - When players are marked with 1, 2, 3, or 4, this will indicate the
            order the boss attacks them, so all players should avoid each other
            while this attack plays out.

          - type: Regular
            name: Exorcise
            roles:
              - Everyone
            tags:

                stack on their location.
              - Note that where you stack, a 5th puddle will drop, so
                immediately move out when possible.
  - name: Lightwarden Philia
    phases:
      - notes:
          - When a player is chained by the boss, attack the chain on them as
            fast as possible or they will die.
          - Pay attention to which leg the boss lifts and move to the opposite
            side of the arena.
          - During fierce beating, it's safer to be on the boss' right side, so
            if you can position there, great.
        attacks:
          - type: Regular
            name: Scavenger's Daughter
            roles:
              - Healer
            tags:

                necessary.
          - type: Regular
            name: Headcrusher
            roles:
              - Tank
              - Healer
            tags:
              - Tankbuster
            notes:

            roles:

              - Everyone
            tags:
              - Spread
              - AoE (Proximity)
            notes:
              - The tank will be marked with a spread marker - all players
                should move as far away from them as possible.
              - At the same time, a proximity AoE will be placed in the center
                of the arena - all players, tank included should move to the
                edge of the arena.
              - For optimal damage reduction, the tank should run to the edge
                the boss is facing, while everyone else should go to the edge
                behind the boss.
          - type: Regular

            roles:

              - Stun
              - Marker (Red)
              - AoE (Cone)
            notes:
              - A random player will be chained in place, and the boss will
                target them with a large cone AoE.
              - All remaining players should immediately destroy the chain
                holding the player in place and then leave the danger area.
              - The cone AoE will persist for a bit, so avoid running into it
                before it finishes.
          - type: Regular

              - AoE (Area)
            notes:
              - The boss will lift one of its legs and slam it down on that side
                of the arena.

              - AoE (Circle)
            notes:

                players.

            tags:
              - Line-of-sight
            notes:
              - One player will be marked with a line-of-sight marker - all
                players should stand in a line between the boss and the player
                to soak damage.
          - type: Combo
            name: Fierce Beating

                tags:
                  - AoE (Point-blank)
                notes:
                  - Throughout the duration of Fierce Beating, the boss' hitbox
                    will always be a damage zone.
              - name: Ground Smash
                roles:
                  - Everyone
                tags:
                  - AoE (Column)
                notes:
                  - The boss will slam its fists down in front of it.
                  - After the attack executes, the boss will turn and perform
                    the attack again. This will continue until it completes a
                    full circle.
              - name: Tailswipe
                roles:
                  - Everyone
                tags:
                  - AoE (Cone)
                notes:
                  - At the same time that the boss is smashing the ground in
                    front of it, it will also attack in a wide cone with its
                    tail.
                  - The safe zone is on boss' sides, but not in its hitbox.
